  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>This SRFI defines a standard command-line flag to get version
  information from a Scheme implementation. The output is
  Line-oriented S-expressions which are easy to parse from Scheme,
  C, and shell scripts and can co-exist with non-S-expression
  output. A standard vocabulary is defined; extensions are easy to
  make.</p>

  <h2 id="_rationale">Rationale</h2>
  <p>The implementation of this SRFI boils down to a few
  <strong>write</strong> calls. But careful planning has gone into
  the details of those calls.</p>
  <h3 id="_introduction">Introduction</h3>
  <p>There is a long tradition of complex command line programs
  having a version flag. This flag skips the normal operation of
  the program; instead, it writes version information to standard
  output and immediately exits. The flag is useful for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Checking that the desired program is installed, and not
    another program by the same name. For example, several Schemes
    have command name conflicts. <code>csc</code> conflicts with
    the C# compiler. <code>gsc</code> conflicts with the
    GhostScript interpreter. <code>scheme</code> conflicts between
    Chez Scheme and MIT Scheme.</li>
    <li>Checking that the version and configuration of the program
    are compatible with your goals.</li>
    <li>Finding out how old the program is (i.e. what year it was
    made) and how to contact the maintainer.</li>
    <li>Giving general information to include in build logs and bug
    reports.</li>
    <li>Doing all of the above in a fast, simple, standard way. A
    version flag is often faster than starting a REPL, running a
    script or evaluating an expression since the implementation can
    skip loading most or all Scheme libraries.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Cyclone and Vicare have a "version number only" flag
  (<code>cyclone -vn</code> and <code>vicare --version-only</code>,
  respectively). Gauche has a flag to load another version of
  itself. These features are not addressed by this SRFI.</p>
  <h4 id="_which_flag_to_choose">Which flag to choose</h4>
  <p>The first problem is that long options (<code>-version</code>
  and <code>--version</code>) do not have a universally agreed-upon
  syntax. Perhaps most programs now adhere to the GNU-style
  two-dash syntax. However, many prominent ones such as C compilers
  and fundamental X Window System utilities continue to use the
  one-dash syntax. There are many Schemes supporting only one of
  those variants, and many that do not have long options at
  all.</p>
  <p>One-letter options are much more standardized; so much in
  fact, that almost all Unix programs have supported them ever
  since Unix was first published. While programs disagree on
  whether to interpret a group of letters after one dash as a
  single one-word option or as multiple one-letter options, there
  is no ambiguity when only one letter follows the dash. The
  convention is especially strong when the flag is the only
  argument after the program name.</p>
  <p><strong>Lower-case</strong> <code>-v</code> is the most
  popular one-letter flag in the survey. However, it is commonly
  used by programs for their "verbose" flag — including a few
  Scheme implementations.</p>
  <p><strong>Upper-case</strong> <code>-V</code> is less popular
  but has no known conflicting uses. (Racket uses <code>-V</code>
  as an alias for <code>--no-yield</code> but makes an exception
  and treats <code>racket -V</code> with no other arguments as a
  version flag.) It is a strong standard for a version flag among
  Unix programs in general. <em>Hence we choose the upper-case
  <code>-V</code> flag for this SRFI.</em></p>
  <h4 id="_parser_friendly_output_format">Parser-friendly output
  format</h4>
  <p>Many Scheme/Lisp implementations and other Unix tools output
  version information in a format that is quite stable. The idea is
  that the information can be parsed by other programs and scripts.
  Often the output format is almost regular but not quite. Some of
  the more complex formats, while stable, are not self-consistent
  since they evolved over time from an <em>ad hoc</em> syntax;
  outside of Scheme, <code>clisp --version</code> and <code>clang
  --version</code> are good examples.</p>
  <p>This SRFI mandates a very simple S-expression syntax that is a
  subset of Scheme’s standard syntax. Implementations can easily
  write out the information using the standard
  <strong>write</strong> procedure as long as the expressions given
  to <strong>write</strong> are suitably constrained. Version
  output is naturally represented as an association list of
  properties and their values. Each association shall be written as
  a separate S-expression; the full list is implicit. The precise
  output format is slightly unconventional and is presented in the
  next part.</p>
  <h3 id="_part_2_line_oriented_s_expressions_lose">Part 2:
  Line-oriented S-expressions (LOSE)</h3>
  <h4 id="_background">Background</h4>
  <p>The Lisp tradition offers easy handling of nested data. But we
  sometimes have to interoperate with languages that don't.</p>
  <p>In particular, Unix shell scripts generally parse their input
  using the traditional tools <code>awk</code>, <code>grep</code>,
  and <code>sed</code> that are based around <em>regular
  expressions</em>. Regexps are notoriously unable to handle nested
  structure. Perhaps for that reason, Unix shells also make it
  difficult to store nested data in variables. Even string list
  handling is clumsy and error-prone.</p>
  <p>The other classic Unix programming environment, the C
  language, makes it easy to <em>represent</em> nested data. But
  <em>handling</em> it is difficult due to the lack of standard
  tools. Almost all of the data processing functions in the
  standard library are string functions. Thus we come back to the
  same situation as with shell scripts: only strings are easy to
  process from standard C.</p>
  <h4 id="_example">Example</h4>
  <p>The following S-expression:</p>
  <pre>(version "1.2.3")</pre>
  <p>Can be easily parsed even with ancient versions of
  <code>grep</code> and <code>sed</code>:</p>
  <pre>grep '^(version ".*".*)$'      \
    | sed -e 's/^(version "//' \
          -e 's/".*//'</pre>
  <p>The <code>sed</code> command <code>s/whatever//</code>
  replaces <code>whatever</code> with the empty string.
  <code>whatever</code> is a regular expression.</p>
  <p>An equivalent parser can be written in <code>awk</code>. It’s
  a bit more verbose but avoids using a shell pipeline:</p>
  <pre>awk -F '[()]' \
    '/^\(version .*\)$/ {
        sub(/^[a-z-]+ /, "", $2);
        gsub(/"/, "", $2);
        print $2
    }'</pre>
  <p>Again, the Awk command <code>sub(/whatever/, "",
  $variable)</code> replaces the regular expression
  <code>whatever</code> with the empty string. <code>gsub</code>
  replaces all occurrences on the line whereas <code>sub</code>
  replaces only the first. Awk splits each line into numbered input
  fields at the separator <code>[()]</code>.</p>
  <p>These commands work with the POSIX standard versions of these
  tools. They have been tested with the bare-bones versions in
  BusyBox, meaning they are quite conservative.</p>
  <p>Parsing from C is surprisingly easy as well:</p>
  <pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

static char output[1024];

static const char *parse_version(void)
{
    const char prefix[] = "\n(version \"";
    char *start;
    char *limit;

    if ((start = strstr(output, prefix)) == NULL) {
        return "";
    }
    start += strlen(prefix);
    for (limit = start; *limit != '"'; limit++) {
        if ((*limit == '\0') || (*limit == '\n') || (*limit == '\\')) {
            return "";
        }
    }
    *limit = '\0';
    return start;
}

int main(void)
{
    output[0] = '\n';
    fread(&amp;output[1], 1, sizeof(output) - 2, stdin);
    printf("%s\n", parse_version());
    return 0;
}</pre>
  <p>When reading this code, note that C implicitly initializes the
  <code>output</code> buffer to all all zero bytes. In order to
  find <code>(version "1.2.3")</code> when it is the first line of
  output, a newline character <code>\n</code> is artificially
  prepended to the real output. When reading we additionally leave
  one zero byte at the end of the output buffer to ensure the
  buffer is null-terminated. The <code>parse_version</code>
  function mutates the output buffer by replacing the closing
  double-quote in <code>(version "1.2.3")</code> with a null byte.
  Then we can easily handle the substring <code>1.2.3</code> as a
  null-terminated string.</p>
  <h4 id="_assumptions_made">Assumptions made</h4>
  <p>In order for the above S-expression parsing to be robust, it
  relies on some concessions from the program writing the
  output:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Each top-level S-expression begins at the first character
    of a line.</li>
    <li>There is no extraneous whitespace after closing
    parentheses, or between tokens.</li>
    <li>Any nested multi-line S-expressions have whitespace for
    indentation at the beginning of each continuation line. That
    distinguishes those lines from lines that begin a top-level
    S-expression. Simple parsers will skip multi-line expressions
    since those expressions don’t match a single-line pattern of a
    complete S-expression with open and close parentheses.</li>
    <li>Symbols use a restricted character set.</li>
    <li>The output does not have multi-line comments, so the parser
    does not have to figure out which lines are inside a
    comment.</li>
    <li>The output has no null bytes.</li>
    <li>The output uses a character encoding where the bytes
    #x01..#x7e map to ASCII characters (e.g. UTF-8 or
    ISO-8859).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>At first glance, this looks like a big list of restrictions.
  But in practice, they are not hard to conform to for simple
  data.</p>
  <h4 id="_easy_forms">Easy forms</h4>
  <p>The following LOSE forms are quite easy to parse reliably.
  This SRFI uses them exclusively, and the sample implementation
  offers ready-made parsers for them.</p>
  <p>(<em>symbol</em> <em>string…​</em>)</p>
  <p>(<em>symbol</em> <em>symbol/integer…​</em>)</p>
  <p>(<em>symbol</em> (<em>symbol</em> <em>symbol/integer</em>)
  …​)</p>
  <h3 id="_part_3_backward_compatibility">Part 3: Backward
  compatibility</h3>
  <p>To let implementations keep their existing version output for
  backward-compatibility, LOSE parsing starts at the first line
  with a left parenthesis <code>(</code> at the first column. This
  means that any amount of other text can come before the
  S-expression part. Some Unix programs write a multi-paragraph
  copyright, warranty and version message; all of that can be
  preserved if desired.</p>
  <p>This simple arrangement makes all of the following work
  naturally:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Only S-expression info: If the very first character in the
    output is a <code>(</code> then the entire output is parsed as
    the association list.</li>
    <li>No S-expression info: If no line starts with a
    <code>(</code> then the parser simply returns an empty
    association list. This means that all known Scheme
    implementations with an existing <code>-V</code> flag are
    already compatible with this SRFI. It’s just a matter of adding
    output, not changing anything.</li>
    <li>No info at all: If the output if completely blank, in that
    case the parser also returns an empty association list.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="_conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
  <p>The best argument for using S-expressions generally is that
  people keep re-inventing them in less consistent and flexible
  formats without an objective reason. We will save time and effort
  by using time-tested syntax from the beginning. Easy
  interoperability with Scheme/Lisp is an obvious plus.</p>
  <p>The main arguments against S-expressions is that they look
  foreign to non-Lisp programmers and require too many parentheses.
  The nesting implied by the parentheses makes them a poor fit for
  line-oriented tools. All the classic Unix text processing
  utilities are line-oriented. To interoperate with these tools we
  need a compromise. The easiest compromise is to write each
  association list entry on its own line, which leaves most lines
  with only one pair parentheses and no nesting. Nested lists in
  the output will be rare.</p>
  <p>We could take this even further by using implied parentheses
  around each line of text, so that no parentheses are needed for
  most output lines. This should make the output completely
  un-scary even for Unix programmers who know nothing about Lisp.
  Unfortunately this syntax would make it hard to provide
  backward-compatibility with the many existing output formats for
  version info. Having a left parenthesis in the first column is a
  simple and unambiguous rule. If there are no such syntactic
  markers, parsing will be a lot harder. Most natural candidates
  for a syntactic marker are also more ambiguous than a left
  parenthesis. For example, <code>property: value</code> pairs are
  harder to detect and easier to confuse with other things.</p>
  <h2 id="_specification">Specification</h2>
  <h3 id="_character_set_and_encoding">Character set and
  encoding</h3>
  <p>The version output should be in an ASCII superset character
  encoding, so that bytes <code>#x01..#x7e</code> correspond to
  those ASCII codepoints. The encoding of bytes outside this range
  is unspecified; UTF-8 is recommended where possible.</p>
  <p>ASCII space (<code>#x20</code>), carriage return
  (<code>#x0d</code>) and line feed (<code>#x0a</code>) characters
  are recognized as whitespace.</p>
  <p>On Unix, only a single line feed character (LF) is recognized
  as a newline.</p>
  <p>On Windows, either a single line feed character (LF)
  <em>or</em> a carriage return followed by a line feed (CR/LF) can
  be used as a newline.</p>
  <h3 id="_line_oriented_s_expressions_lose">Line-oriented
  S-expressions (LOSE)</h3>
  <p>The version output shall conform to the following subset of
  Scheme syntax:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Symbol: Written plainly as <code>foo</code> with the first
    character being one of <code>[A-Za-z]</code> and any subsequent
    characters among <code>[A-Za-z0-9_/*+.-]</code>.</li>
    <li>String: <code>"string"</code> with support for the
    backslash escapes <code>\"</code> and <code>\\</code>. Other
    backslash escapes do not work reliably and should be avoided.
    Strings cannot contain newlines. Non-graphic characters do not
    work reliably and should be avoided.</li>
    <li>Non-negative exact integer: <code>123</code>. No leading
    zeros.</li>
    <li>List: <code>() (a) (a b) (a b c)</code>. Exactly one space
    between adjacent elements. No whitespace between the open
    parenthesis and the first element. No whitespace between the
    last element and the close parenthesis. No whitespace between
    the open and close parentheses in an empty list. Lists can be
    nested, but it generally makes line-oriented work
    difficult.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>LOSE symbols are case-sensitive. Letter case is preserved when
  reading them in.</p>
  <p>Top-level S-expressions must all be lists. A top-level open
  parenthesis must fall on the first column of a line, and there
  must be a newline immediately after a top-level close
  parenthesis. There must be a newline even after the last
  top-level list in the output, i.e. the output must end with a
  final newline, Unix style.</p>
  <p>Multi-line S-expressions are not recognized by line-oriented
  tools and should hence be avoided; if required, then continuation
  lines of nested expressions must start with one space.</p>
  <p>Missing features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Booleans <code>#t</code> and <code>#f</code> (due to
    interoperability concerns with other Lisps).</li>
    <li>Vertical-bar symbols.</li>
    <li>Improper lists (i.e. consing dot) and shared
    structure.</li>
    <li>Vectors and bytevectors.</li>
    <li>Numbers other than non-negative exact integers: negative
    numbers, inexact numbers, ratios, complex numbers, etc.</li>
    <li>Records, hash-tables, etc.</li>
    <li>Syntax for unique objects and non-printable objects.</li>
    <li>Comments.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Suggested workarounds:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Write fancy symbols or numbers as strings.</li>
    <li>Instead of booleans, use enumerations or sets. For example,
    instead of <code>(linux? #t)</code> use something like
    <code>(build.platform "…​linux…​")</code> or
    <code>(scheme.features …​ linux …​)</code>.</li>
    <li>Nested lists are hard to parse with line-oriented tools.
    One trick is using symbols with dots to create namespaces like
    <code>level1.level2.level3</code>.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="_use_of_color_and_other_display_attributes">Use of color
  and other display attributes</h3>
  <p>ANSI, HTML or other in-band color and text attribute markup
  shall not be used in the S-expression part of the output since it
  will confuse parsers.</p>
  <p>An exception is if the implementation can be sure that the
  output is going to a terminal (instead of a file, pipe, etc.) On
  Unix, <code>isatty()</code> is an adequate check.</p>
  <p>Out-of-band markup (e.g. Windows console character attributes)
  may be used.</p>
  <h3 id="_version_flag">Version flag</h3>
  <p>For a Scheme invoked as <code>fantastic-scheme</code>, the
  command line <code>fantastic-scheme -V</code> (i.e.
  <strong>upper-case</strong> <code>V</code> preceded by one dash)
  must conform to the version output format in this SRFI.</p>
  <p>Specifically, LOSE parsing starts at the first output line
  that has a left parenthesis <code>(</code> in the first column
  with no preceding whitespace characters. Parsing continues from
  that line until the end of the output. The parser collects every
  top-level S-expression into one big association list, preserving
  the order. If there is no line starting with a left parenthesis,
  an empty association list is returned.</p>
  <p>This SRFI guarantees only that the above simple command
  invocation, with <code>-V</code> as the first command-line
  argument and no other arguments, has the intended effect. The
  implementation should also support the <code>-V</code> flag in
  other argument positions if it makes sense, and it should have
  the same output format as when it is the only command line
  argument, but neither of those is strictly required.</p>
  <p>When the <code>-V</code> flag is used as above, the command
  shall exit with a success exit code if it:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>retrieved the information it intended to</li>
    <li>successfully wrote all that information to the
    <strong>standard output</strong> port and flushed the output
    buffer; and</li>
    <li>wrote nothing to the standard error port</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Otherwise it shall exit with a failure exit code. On Unix and
  Windows, exit code 0 means success and codes 1..100 are safe to
  use for indicating failure.</p>
  <h3 id="_other_version_flags_and_multiple_commands">Other version
  flags and multiple commands</h3>
  <p>All interpreter and compiler commands supplied by the
  implementation must support the <code>-V</code> flag as the only
  argument.</p>
  <p>The implementation may additionally support <code>-v</code>,
  <code>-version</code>, <code>--version</code> and/or other
  version flags, but none of these are required. To present a
  simple interface to users, all version flags should ideally give
  the same output, but that is not required either.</p>
  <p>Besides the compiler and interpreter commands, any other
  commands supplied by the implementation are also encouraged to
  support the same version flags, but are not required to.</p>
  <p>The version output is allowed to differ between commands.</p>
  <h3 id="_effect_of_non_version_flags_on_version_information">
  Effect of non-version flags on version information</h3>
  <p>The <code>-V</code> output may change if other flags are also
  given on the command line. For example, <code>fantastic-scheme -V
  -r r6rs</code> and <code>fantastic-scheme -V -r r7rs</code> could
  give different output describing the R6RS and R7RS modes of
  Fantastic Scheme, and <code>fantastic-scheme -V</code> could give
  yet different output describing both of them or have less
  information.</p>
  <h3 id="_version_runtime_option">-:version runtime option</h3>
  <p>If the Scheme system has a <code>-:</code> flag for runtime
  options (as do Chicken and Gambit), it shall recognize
  <code>-:version</code> and behave compatibly with the
  <code>-V</code> flag. If the <code>version</code> runtime option
  comes from an environment variable or some other place than
  command line arguments, it is permitted to cause an error.</p>
  <h3 id="_accessing_from_scheme">Accessing from Scheme</h3>
  <p>Implementations shall provide a
  (<strong>version-alist</strong>) procedure that can be called
  from Scheme and returns an association list of zero or more
  properties according to this specification. Ideally it should
  return roughly the same information as the <code>-V</code>
  command line flag, but this is not required. It is an error for
  the caller to modify the list returned.</p>
  <p>Implementations supporting the R7RS module system shall
  provide a <code>(srfi 176)</code> library with the procedure.</p>
  <p>Implementations supporting the R6RS module system shall
  provide a <code>(srfi :176)</code> library with the
  procedure.</p>
  <p>The procedure may also be exported by other libraries. It's
  implementation-defined whether or not it's imported into the
  default interaction environment.</p>
  <h3 id="_standalone_executables">Standalone executables</h3>
  <p>If the Scheme implementation can generate standalone
  executables or bundles of user programs, those executables:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>should support the (<strong>version-alist</strong>) Scheme
    procedure.</li>
    <li>should support the <code>-:version</code> runtime option if
    they support the <code>-:</code> runtime option syntax.</li>
    <li>should <strong>not</strong> have a <code>-V</code> flag
    provided by the Scheme implementation, since a program is
    supposed to have control over its own command line syntax and
    may want to customize its own version output.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="_date_and_time">Date and time</h3>
  <p>In standard properties, dates and times are written in
  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339">RFC 3339</a>
  format. It is a restricted form of the international standard
  date format specified in <a href=
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a>.</p>
  <p>We always use upper-case <code>T</code> for the date/time
  separator and upper-case <code>Z</code> for the UTC time zone
  marker. The UTC offset <code>-00:00</code> (i.e. negative zero)
  indicates an unknown time zone.</p>
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>2019-12-14</code> (local date only)</li>
    <li><code>2019-12-14T20:00+02:00</code> (local date and
    time)</li>
    <li><code>2019-12-14T18:00Z</code> (UTC date and time)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Unix shell commands to output the current date and time in
  these formats:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>date '+%Y-%m-%d'</code></li>
    <li><code>date '+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M%z' | sed
    's@^.\{19\}@&amp;:@'</code></li>
    <li><code>date -u '+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%MZ'</code></li>
  </ul>
  <p>The <code>%z</code> conversion specification is the only
  non-POSIX feature in these commands. <code>%z</code> gives a
  <code>±HHMM</code> time zone offset under every modern Unix-like
  operating system. The <code>sed</code> command converts that to
  <code>±HH:MM</code>. The ISO C99 <code>strftime()</code> function
  standardizes <code>%z</code> with the same format. C code to
  output the above date formats is included with the sample
  implementation of this SRFI. Most popular programming languages
  have a ready-made library function to parse RFC 3339
  timestamps.</p>
  <h3 id="_standard_properties">Standard properties</h3>
  <p>Below is a large set of proposed standard properties. This set
  was designed based on actual information currently reported by
  various Scheme implementations in their version output.</p>
  <p><strong>All properties are optional.</strong> That implies any
  Scheme implementation with a <code>-V</code> version flag writing
  only to standard output, no output lines starting with
  <code>(</code> already conforms to this SRFI.</p>
  <p>The order in which the properties are given does not matter.
  Writers should not write properties with duplicate names; readers
  should pick the first property matching a given property
  name.</p>
  <h4 id="_general_properties">General properties</h4>
  <p>(<strong>command</strong> <em>string…​</em>)</p>
  <p>The command names for some Schemes differ on different
  operating systems and installations. Implementors typically
  desire a canonical command name for each command shipping with
  their implementation, but compromises sometimes need to be made
  due to name conflicts or multiple versions of the same command
  that need to be able to coexist. This property gives the
  canonical name suggested by the implementor without any optional
  version number.</p>
  <p>If the executable being invoked is a multi-call binary (i.e.
  it can behave like more than one program depending on which
  argv[0] is given) or otherwise is known by more than one
  canonical name, then more than one string may be given.</p>
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <pre>(command "csi")
(command "gosh")
(command "gsc")
(command "isc")
(command "scheme" "mit-scheme")</pre>
  <p>(<strong>website</strong> <em>string</em>)</p>
  <p>The URL for the Scheme implementation's website.</p>
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <pre>(website "https://practical-scheme.net/gauche")</pre>
  <p>(<strong>install-dir</strong> <em>string</em>)</p>
  <p>Root directory of the Scheme installation, if it has one.
  Typically, this is the directory that has <code>bin</code> and
  <code>lib</code> subdirectories, but the meaning is
  implementation-dependent.</p>
  <p>This directory is often set by a build-time option called
  <em>prefix</em> in the implementation's configure script or
  makefile.</p>
  <p>(<strong>languages</strong> <em>symbol…​</em>)</p>
  <p>The set of programming languages supported by the
  implementation. Symbols denote set membership.</p>
  <p>The distinctions between <em>language</em>, <em>language
  standard</em>, <em>language family</em> and <em>dialect</em> are
  muddy. For the purposes of this property, they are all
  equivalent, and any of them may be represented by a symbol in
  this property. For example, <code>r7rs</code> is a member of
  <code>scheme</code> and both should be given. Non-Scheme
  languages could also be listed. If a unified Scheme and Common
  Lisp implementation is ever made, it would list both
  languages.</p>
  <p>This property means that the implementation aspires to conform
  to these languages to a useful degree, and if it does not, you
  can open issues in the issue tracker to discuss it. Guarantees
  about conformance and pedantry about language definitions are not
  the point. In particular, any executable usefully characterized
  as a Scheme implementation should list <code>scheme</code> even
  if it does not fully conform to any R<sup>n</sup>RS report.</p>
  <p>Standard symbols include <code>r3rs</code>, <code>r4rs</code>,
  <code>r5rs</code>, <code>r6rs</code>, <code>r7rs</code>,
  <code>r7rs-large</code>, <code>scheme</code>. Please coordinate
  with other implementors about coining symbols for other Scheme
  derivatives and non-Scheme languages.</p>
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <pre>(languages scheme r6rs r7rs)</pre>
  <p>(<strong>encodings</strong> <em>symbol…</em>)</p>
  <p>Each <em>symbol</em> is the <strong>lowercase</strong>
  <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets/">IANA
  name</a> of a character encoding known to be supported by this
  build of the Scheme implementation.</p>
  <p>All encoding names in the IANA list can be represented as LOSE
  symbols except for names with a year suffix: e.g.
  <code>ISO_8859-1:1987</code>.</p>
  <p>It is permitted to list more than one alias for the same
  encoding.</p>
  <p>The <strong>default encoding</strong> selected at start-up
  time should come <strong>first</strong> in the list. The default
  may change based on command line options, environment variables
  or other environmental factors.</p>
  <p>The implementation may also support other encodings not listed
  here, either natively or via extensions.</p>
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <pre>(encodings utf-8 iso-8859-1)</pre>
  <p>(<strong>version</strong> <em>string</em>)</p>
  <p>A free-form version string in the native format preferred by
  the implementor. No portable information can be reliably parsed
  from the string, but version strings should be sortable in order
  from oldest to newest using typical "version sort"
  algorithms.</p>
  <p>In practice, most Scheme implementations use release version
  numbers in <em>major.minor.patch</em> format. Other information
  such as distributor patchlevel or version control commit may be
  appended.</p>
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <pre>(version "1.2.3")
(version "1.11.6")
(version "0.9.9_pre1")
(version "1.0.188-a4a79d5")
(version "4.3f")</pre>
  <h4 id="_release_properties">Release properties</h4>
  <p>(<strong>release</strong> <em>string</em>)</p>
  <p>The most recent released version of the implementation based
  on which this build was made. If this <em>is</em> that release
  version, then <strong>version</strong> is identical to this. If
  this has patches on top, then the two versions are different.</p>
  <p>(<strong>release.date</strong> <em>iso-date-string</em>)</p>
  <p>The date on which the release was made.</p>
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <pre>(release.date "2019-08-06")</pre>
  <p>(<strong>release.name</strong> <em>string</em>)</p>
  <p>A codename for the release.</p>
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <pre>(release.name "Grain Alcohol and Rainwater")
(release.name "oxygen")</pre>
  <h4 id="_build_properties">Build properties</h4>
  <p>(<strong>build.date</strong> <em>iso-date-string</em>)</p>
  <p>The date and time when this executable was built.</p>
  <p>It is implementation-dependent whether the timestamp is nearer
  to the start or end of the build.</p>
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <pre>(build.date "2018-09-30")
(build.date "2018-09-30T02:07Z")
(build.date "2018-09-30T02:07+02:00")
(build.date "2018-09-30T02:07-05:30")</pre>
  <p>(<strong>build.platform</strong> <em>string</em>)</p>
  <p>A free-form string identifying the computer architecture,
  operating system, and/or other aspects of the computing platform
  for which the executable was built. This is the platform string
  in the implementation’s native format; there is no portable
  information that can be reliably parsed. Often this is a
  GNU-style <code>computer-kernel-userland</code> triple; just as
  often it is not.</p>
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <pre>(build.platform "DarwinX8664")
(build.platform "x86_64-apple-darwin18.7.0")
(build.platform "macosx-unix-clang-x86-64")</pre>
  <p>(<strong>build.configure</strong> <em>string</em>…​)</p>
  <p>Command line arguments given to the configure script before
  building this Scheme implementation. A configure script is a
  common means for build-time configuration of programs on
  Unix-like operating systems. It is useful to save the options
  given to that script for run time: knowing them helps replicate
  builds and debug problems with the implementation.</p>
  <p>Each command line argument is given as one string.
  S-expression string escapes are used; since the double-quoted
  string syntax used with S-expressions is largely compatible with
  Unix shells, the resulting syntax can generally be pasted to a
  shell with no changes.</p>
  <p>The name of the configure script is not given. It is almost
  always <code>configure</code>, though that is not required.</p>
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <pre>(build.configure "--enable-single-host")
(build.configure "--prefix=/home/wiley/.local" "CC=gcc-9")</pre>
  <p>(<strong>build.git.tag</strong> <em>string</em>)<br>
  (<strong>build.git.branch</strong> <em>string</em>)<br>
  (<strong>build.git.commit</strong> <em>string</em>)<br>
  (<strong>build.git.modified</strong> <em>string…​</em>)</p>
  <p>The state of the Git version control repository from which the
  build was made.</p>
  <p>These can be got from the following Unix shell command:</p>
  <p>Tag:</p>
  <pre>git describe --tags --abbrev=0 2&gt;/dev/null || true</pre>
  <p>Branch:</p>
  <pre>git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2&gt;/dev/null || true</pre>
  <p>Commit:</p>
  <pre>git rev-parse --short HEAD 2&gt;/dev/null || true</pre>
  <p>List of files with uncommitted changes:</p>
  <pre>
printf '(build.git.modified';
git diff-index --name-only HEAD 2&gt;/dev/null | head | xargs -n 1 printf ' "%s"';
echo ')'</pre>
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <pre>(build.git.tag "3.1.1")
(build.git.branch "master")
(build.git.commit "8e62f718")
(build.git.modified "c/char.c" "c/env.c" "c/env_unix.c" "c/scheme.h")</pre>
  <h4 id="_image_properties">Image properties</h4>
  <p>(<strong>image.date</strong> <em>iso-date-string</em>)</p>
  <p>If this is an image-based Scheme system, the date and time
  when the active boot image was saved.</p>
  <p>This may vary by command line options and environment
  variables if those can be used to select a different boot
  image.</p>
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <pre>(image.date "2018-09-30")
(image.date "2018-09-30T02:07Z")
(image.date "2018-09-30T02:07+02:00")
(image.date "2018-09-30T02:07-05:30")</pre>
  <p>(<strong>image.file</strong> <em>string</em>)</p>
  <p>If images can be loaded by filename, <em>string</em> gives the
  filename that is used to load the active boot image.</p>
  <h4 id="_scheme_properties">Scheme properties</h4>
  <p>These properties deal with things directly related to the
  Scheme programming language.</p>
  <p>(<strong>scheme.id</strong> <em>symbol</em>)</p>
  <p>A symbol identifying which Scheme implementation provides this
  executable. Together with <strong>command</strong> this can be
  used to figure out which command of which implementation was
  invoked, even in cases where two implementations use the same
  command name.</p>
  <p>At the time of writing, there is no central registry for
  Scheme ID's.</p>
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <pre>(scheme.id fantastic)
(scheme.id gauche)
</pre>
  <p>(<strong>scheme.srfi</strong> <em>integer…</em>)</p>
  <p>Each <em>integer</em> gives the number of a SRFI supported
  natively by the implementation. The integer <code>0</code> stands
  for <em>Feature-based conditional expansion construct</em>,
  <code>1</code> stands for <em>List Library</em>, <code>176</code>
  stands for <em>Version flag</em>, etc.</p>
  <p>The <em>integer</em>s shall be listed in order from smallest
  to largest.</p>
  <p>If the implementation supports a particular SRFI via a library
  or extension that is not built or installed, that SRFI shall not
  be listed.</p>
  <p>A partially supported SRFI should not be listed unless the
  implementor has plans for full support and users can report
  missing features as bugs.</p>
  <p>The implementation does not need to list every SRFI it
  supports, as there may be situations where that is hard to
  define. The absence of a number does not conclusively prove that
  SRFI is not supported.</p>
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <pre>(scheme.srfi)
(scheme.srfi 0 1 13 14 176)
</pre>
  <p>(<strong>scheme.features</strong> <em>symbol…​</em>)</p>
  <p>The symbols should correspond to the feature list for
  <strong>cond-expand</strong>.</p>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Only symbols conforming to the LOSE
  symbol syntax can be listed for compatibility reasons. Other
  symbols from the feature list need to be filtered out. In
  particular, Scheme symbols cannot portably start with digits so
  LOSE does not allow it either. This is not generally a problem
  since Scheme implementations do not tend to have such feature
  identifiers, but some of them may.</p>
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <pre>(scheme.features)
(scheme.features dload ptables)
(scheme.features utf-8 pthreads linux r7rs)
(scheme.features chibi r7rs ratios complex uvector threads full-unicode)
(scheme.features modules dynamic-loading darwin bsd macosx little-endian)</pre>
  <p>(<strong>scheme.path</strong> <em>string…​</em>)</p>
  <p>List of directories to search for imported libraries. Listed
  in order of decreasing priority: highest priority first.</p>
  <h4 id="_c_properties">C properties</h4>
  <p>If the Scheme implementation is written in the C programming
  language and/or has a C foreign function interface, it can
  provide these properties to give information about the C side of
  things.</p>
  <p>(<strong>c.version</strong> <em>string</em>)</p>
  <p>A free-form version string describing the C compiler or
  toolchain being used.</p>
  <p>Expect this to be difficult to parse reliably, like HTTP
  user-agent strings.</p>
  <p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/predef/wiki/">Pre-defined
  Compiler Macros</a> is a site listing the C preprocessor macros
  set by lots of compilers to reveal their version information.</p>
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <pre>
(c.version "GCC 9.2.0")
(c.version "GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.46.4)")
(c.version "Open Watcom 1.9")</pre>
  <p>(<strong>c.compile</strong> <em>string…</em>)<br>
  (<strong>c.link</strong> <em>string…</em>)</p>
  <p>The command name and any fixed command line arguments for the
  C compiler/linker used to build the Scheme implementation.</p>
  <p>If same command is used for compiling and linking, both
  <strong>c.compile</strong> and <strong>c.link</strong> may be
  given with the same values, or only <strong>c.compile</strong>
  may be given and <strong>c.link</strong> omitted.</p>
  <p>Each command line argument is given as one string.
  S-expression string escapes are used; since the double-quoted
  string syntax used with S-expressions is largely compatible with
  Unix shells, the resulting syntax can generally be pasted to a
  shell with no changes.</p>
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <pre>
(c.compile "clang" "-Wall" "-Werror" "-Wextra" "-O2" "-D" "NDEBUG")
(c.link "clang" "-lm")</pre>
  <p>(<strong>c.type-bits</strong> (<em>symbol</em>
  <em>integer</em>) …​)</p>
  <p>Tells the sizes of C data types. Each <em>symbol</em> is the
  name of a C type and <em>integer</em> gives giving the width of
  the type in bits. The size of type <code>t</code> can be
  determined in C using:</p>
  <pre>#include &lt;limits.h&gt;  // For CHAR_BIT
#define BITSIZEOF(t) (sizeof(t) * CHAR_BIT)
printf("%zu\n", BITSIZEOF(void *));
</pre>
  <p>It's completely up to the implementation to decide which types
  are listed. The list can include non-standard types from the
  operating system and third-party libraries as well as custom
  types used only by the implementation. Types do not need to be
  sorted by <em>symbol</em> or <em>integer</em>.</p>
  <p>Each C type name is converted to a <em>symbol</em> as
  follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>void *</code> becomes <code>pointer</code> and
    <code>void (*)()</code> becomes
    <code>function-pointer</code></li>
    <li>Any other type <code>foo *</code> becomes
    <code>foo-pointer</code></li>
    <li>Spaces are converted to dashes</li>
    <li>Underscores remain underscores</li>
    <li>Letter case is preserved</li>
  </ul>
  <p>While qualifiers like <code>const</code> and
  <code>unsigned</code> are permitted, they are generally
  superfluous since the unqualified type is the same size. All
  pointer types are generally the same size as a void pointer, but
  the C standard does not guarantee that.</p>
  <p>Examples (for completeness, some silly ones are included):</p>
  <pre>(c.type-bits)
(c.type-bits (pointer 64))
(c.type-bits (int 32) (long 64) (float 32) (double 64) (pointer 64) (size_t 64))
(c.type-bits (struct-timespec 128) (struct-timespec-pointer 64) (time_t 64))
(c.type-bits (long 64) (long-long 64) (intmax_t 64) (intmax_t-pointer 64))
(c.type-bits (long-double 128) (long-double-pointer 64))
(c.type-bits (char-pointer-pointer 32) (jmp_buf 416))

  <p>Writing the version information can be as simple as calling

  <p>The following is a fully functional parser.</p>
  <pre>

  (let skip-until-paren ((line-start? #t))
    (let ((c (peek-char in)))
      (if (not (or (eof-object? c) (and line-start? (char=? c #\())))

  <p>It has plenty of code to gather, read and write version
  information in common situations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Code to read the complete version alist from Scheme (R6RS
    and R7RS), Common Lisp, Clojure, NewLisp, and Emacs Lisp.</li>
    <li>Code to read specific version items from C, awk, grep|sed,
    and PowerShell.</li>
    <li>Code to produce date/timestamps in the correct format from
    C and Unix shell.</li>
    <li>A sample main program for a Scheme implementation,
    Fantastic Scheme, written in C, and a Unix build script that
    writes various information about the build environment into a C
    file during the build process. The main program collects all
    version information into into a Scheme alist, which is
    validated for LOSE compatibility and then written to
    stdout.</li>

  <p>Thanks to John Cowan for detailed feedback on all aspects of
  this SRFI.</p>
  <p>Thanks to Marc Feeley and John for detailed discussions of
  S-expressions that can be parsed from portable shell scripts.</p>
  <p>Thanks to Arthur Gleckler for questioning why the output of
  existing version flags is extended instead of making a new flag
  exclusively for machine-parseable output.</p>
  <p>This SRFI started off as one of those "what if we made this
  simple tweak" hunches. It has now reached a ludicrous length
  considering the triviality of the topic. I am grateful to anyone
  who may want to use LOSE for another application. It will do at
  least a little to justify the effort spent.</p>
